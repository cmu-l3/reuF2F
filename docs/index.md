# ReuF2F

ReuF2F is a benchmark for evaluating coding agents on open mathematical problems from undergraduate research formalized in Lean. Given a *Lean file* with an open *theorem*, a model is tasked with generating a *patch* that proves the theorem or its full negation.

## Overview

ReuF2F provides:

* **Open research problems** - 244 conjectures and open problems from papers produced in undergraduate research programs
* **Proof or refutation** - an accepted proof or an accepted refutation resolves a problem
* **Reproducible evaluation** - Docker-based grading with Comparator, the Lean kernel and nanoda

## Quick Start

```python
# Load the built dataset from the repository root
import json
reuf2f = [json.loads(line) for line in open("test.jsonl")]
```

```bash
# Setup with Docker
git clone https://github.com/cmu-l3/reuF2F.git
cd ReuF2F
pip install -e '.[test]'
cd lean && lake exe cache get && lake build && cd ..
reuf2f images build ./docker
```
